    "description": "This patriotic Ukranian march was arranged by Stepan Charnetsky from traditional march elements in 1914 as a memorial to veterans of World War I. The song has ever since attracted both inspiration and political censorship. Singing  <em>Oi u Luzi</em> in the wrong crowd could get the singer  fined, beaten, or even imprisoned by anti-Ukrainian-nationalist factions in Ukraine and Russia. The song was vehemently repressed during the Soviet era (1919-1991), then following the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, and after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nThe song sings of a Ukrainian national symbol&#8211;the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viburnum_opulus\">red viburnum</a>, a shrub with bright red berries.",

The central metaphor is about the game of Hela Rotan, similar to Tug-of-War. Rotan is the vining palm used to make rope. The song is a parable of competition-as-cooperation between different communities. The song also mentions the drums of Java; which may be a reference to the eruptions of the volcano of Krakatau."

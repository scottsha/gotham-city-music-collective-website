<p>This piece begins with a nightmare in which all music is lost and forgotten. Gradually the world awakens until the Giver of the Song arrives in triumph. Martin describes this song as in part a metaphor for his personal arc to refinding music after the murder of his junior high music teacher.</p>

<p>Berlin originally wrote this piece for the musical <em>Betsy</em> in 1926. While <em>Betsy</em> only ran 39 performances, the song&#8217;s instant popularity catapulted it beyond the original show. <em>Blue Skies</em> became on the the first songs featured in a   talkie,   inspired its own titular Fred Astaire film, and featured prominently in <em>Star Trek</em>. The song was a favorite of Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald, and Lieutenant Commander Data.</p>

Banish the slumber of a weary soul,
That brings forgetfulness of your laws!

O Christ, look with favour upon your faithful people
Now gathered here to praise you;
Receive their hymns offered to your immortal glory;
May they go forth filled with your gifts.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size"><p>I'm limited
Just look at me
I'm limited
And just look at you
You can do all I couldn't do
Glinda
So now it's up to you
For both of us
Now it's up to you
I've heard it said
That people come into our lives
For a reason
Bringing something we must learn
And we are led to those
Who help us most to grow if we let them
And we help them in return
Well, I don't know if I believe that's true
But I know I'm who I am today
Because I knew you
Like a comet pulled from orbit
As it passes the sun
Like a stream that meets a boulder
Halfway through the wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better
But because I knew you
I have been changed for good
It well may be
That we will never meet again
In this lifetime
So, let me say before we part
So much of me
Is made of what I learned from you
You'll be with me
Like a handprint on my heart
And now whatever way our stories end
I know you have rewritten mine
By being my friend
Like a ship blown from its mooring
By a wind off the sea
Like a seed dropped by a sky bird
In a distant wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better
But because I knew you
Because I knew you
I have been changed for good
And just to clear the air
I ask forgiveness
For the things I've done, you blame me for
But then I guess
We know there's blame to share
And none of it seems to matter anymore
Like a comet pulled from orbit (like a ship blown from its mooring)
As it passes the sun (by a wind off the sea)
Like a stream that meets a boulder (like a seed dropped by a bird)
Halfway through the wood (in the wood)
Who can say if I've been changed for the better
I do believe I have been changed for the better
And because I knew you
Because I knew you
Because I knew you
I have been changed
For good</p></blockquote>

<div><h5 class="wp-block-heading">by Christophe Beck and Leo Birenberg. Arranged by Roger Emerson. Lyrics by Christine Hals.</h5></div>
<p>Composed for the 2017 Disney film "Frozen." This arrangement concatenates several choral snippets scattered throughout the film: Heimr Árnadalr, Vuelie, and The Great Thaw. We begin with "Heimr Árnadalr," seen during the coronation of Queen Elsa performed in the film by a red-robed, twelve-member choir shown briefly on screen. The opening title sequence of the film plays "Vuelie", which is later reprised as "The Great Thaw" as Elsa learns to dispell the cursed winter besetting Arendelle. The sung lyrics are in Old Norse.</p>

<div><h5 class="wp-block-heading">Arranged by Ken Steven.</h5></div>
<p>Composer Ken Steven is an Indonesian born composer, and in this piece merges a gives a modern take on a folksong from the island of Maluku in eastern Indonesia. The central metaphor is about the game of Hela Rotan, similar to Tug-of-War. Rotan is the vining palm used to make rope. The song is a parable of competition-as-cooperation between different communities. The song also mentions the drums of Java; which may be a reference to the eruptions of the volcano of Krakatau.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size"><p>There were ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them, but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, "Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!" Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. The foolish said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out." But the wise answered, saying, "What if there isn't enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves." While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, "Lord, Lord, open to us." But he answered, "Most certainly I tell you, I don't know you."</p></blockquote>

<p>This patriotic Ukranian march was arranged by Stepan Charnetsky from traditional march elements in 1914 as a memorial to veterans of World War I. The song has ever since attracted both inspiration and political censorship. Singing  <em>Oi u Luzi</em> in the wrong crowd could get the singer  fined, beaten, or even imprisoned by anti-Ukrainian-nationalist factions in Ukraine and Russia. The song was vehemently repressed during the Soviet era (1919-1991), then following the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, and after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The song sings of a Ukrainian national symbol&#8211;the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viburnum_opulus">red viburnum</a>, a shrub with bright red berries.</p>

Into the world now,
look at me, look at me go!

Out in the wide open spaces around me,
out in the wide open spaces around me.

But as I journey out,
I look within and see,
the spaces inside of me,
yet to be filled,
filled with what I have seen
and what I will be, Oh!

I’m filling the wide open spaces inside of me,
with something I love, 
something I would like to be, be, be.
Filling the wide open spaces inside of me.
Filling the wide open spaces within me.</p></blockquote>

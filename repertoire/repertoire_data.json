    "description": "This patriotic Ukranian march was arranged by Stepan Charnetsky from traditional march elements in 1914 as a memorial to veterans of World War I. The song has ever since attracted both inspiration and political censorship. Singing  <em>Oi u Luzi</em> in the wrong crowd could get the singer  fined, beaten, or even imprisoned by anti-Ukrainian-nationalist factions in Ukraine and Russia. The song was vehemently repressed during the Soviet era (1919-1991), then following the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, and after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nThe song sings of a Ukrainian national symbol&#8211;the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viburnum_opulus\">red viburnum</a>, a shrub with bright red berries.",

The central metaphor is about the game of Hela Rotan, similar to Tug-of-War. Rotan is the vining palm used to make rope. The song is a parable of competition-as-cooperation between different communities. The song also mentions the drums of Java; which may be a reference to the eruptions of the volcano of Krakatau."

The foolish said to the wise, \"Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.\" But the wise answered, saying, \"What if there isn't enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.\" While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.
